# GUI for Image Coloration
Created a GUI application for converting Black and white images to color images using Generative Adversarial Networks.I have uploaded the codes for training the model architecture and creating the GUI application. I have saved the weights of model architecture after training the model then used the same weights in creating GUI. I am pasting the drive link for weights of model architecture I have trained : [Drivelink](https://drive.google.com/file/d/146obo9Dnd-J8I6bNNylEJGh__TZKEX5-/view?usp=share_link)
